# Master Snippets

A collection of random code snippets, logic, and notes that I want to remember for future reference.  
These files may serve as templates, examples, or personal notes and are **not necessarily related** to each other.

## Purpose

- Store important or reusable code snippets and notes.
- Serve as reference for learning or future projects.
- Keep miscellaneous logic and ideas organized in one place.

## Usage

- Browse through the files to find a snippet, template, or note you need.
- Add new snippets or notes as you discover or create useful logic.
- Each file may be independent and serve a different purpose.

## Notes

- No strict structure; files may vary in language and style.
- Meant for personal reference, but can also help explore ideas or learn from them.
